You are thirty? fifty? you feel old? you have never touched a line of code before? You doubt yourself and your capacity to learn new things? especciallly something as daunting as programming. Well im here to tell you something, and you better listen closely. or else, i will make you program stuff. Just kidding. 

I often encounter people who doubt themselves and their potential in having a successfull IT career. I hear statements such as,"oh, im to old for this type of career", "im already 40, i couldnt start programming now". I find this to be a flaud way of thinking. Here are some of the reasons as to why i think it's never too late to get into the IT business and start programming.

### Age
By far the biggest reason of demoralization in people entering IT careers, is due to them thinking that they are too old for veturing into an programming career. This makes me sad, because if you really want to do it, and if you aren't going to do it now, when should you? As long as you have a curious mindset and you you like to code, you should be fine. Ofcourse it also helps to actually monetize your programming hours so that you can also live. Wherever you would get a job as a programmer, you will quite quickly learn the standards of the workingplace, and how they tackle their specific problems. 

### Inteligence
Doesn't require a math genius You dont have to be a mathematical genius, but having some common sense and logical thinking surely helps.

(**focus on one thing**)Don't have to learn everything In the IT landscape, new languages, frameworks, ways of doing things emerge constantly, while old ways fade. Therefore it's better to focus on one thing at a time, and learn it well. Don't stress yourself up if you don't know everything in the beginning.
Feeling of urgency when starting out In the beginning its very common that you want to learn everything that there is to IT. This just isn't possible. Instead focus on one thing, it will speed up the learning process for the next thing you need to learn. Your programmatical thinking will accumulate over time. The key here is consistency.
