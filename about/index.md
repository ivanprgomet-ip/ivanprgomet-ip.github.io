## How it started
I was first introduced to programming in december 2015, when I was asked to do a preparation course to find out what the upcoming education would be all about, and also decide if programming was something for me. Considering that I did not know what I wanted to do for a living at the time, this was an opportunity for me to try something new. As soon as I started doing the assignments for the preparation course, I fell deeply inlove with the constant problem solving and typical trial and error learning process so indicative of programming. 2 years flew by and in december of 2017 i graduated and could now officially call myself a .net developer.

During my education I had the opportunity to work as an intern at 2 very educational and interesting IT companies, [Petra webbyrå](https://www.petra.agency/en/) in Helsingborg, and [Avabrava](http://www.avabrava.se/) in Lund. Here I was mostly working with Mvc, but also came in contact with some windows services, shell scripts etc. A couple of weeks before my graduation I was recruited by [Sigma ITC](https://www.sigmaitc.se/en/) in Malmö, and by the time I was done with school, I immediately started working. No rest for the wicked as they put it! [Sigma ITC](https://www.sigmaitc.se/en/) is still my current work position.

## Currently doing
As said before, currently working as an IT Consultant for [Sigma ITC](https://www.sigmaitc.se/en/) in Malmö, Sweden. My current client is [Trygg-Hansa](https://www.trygghansa.se/) which is owned by RSA, one of the world's largest non-life insurance companies, and offers comprehensive covers of non-life insurance for private persons and companies. My main area of work includes maintenance, management and development of the existing asp.net enterprise systems.
